## Abstract

This document introduces an abstract mechanism that can be used as an element
of Layer 2 protocols, applications, and soft forks on the Handshake blockchain.
We take advantage of the covenant system and in particular the `UPDATE` covenant,
which enables a HNS name owner to commit up to 512 bytes of entirely arbitrary
data at the maximum rate of once per block. Since names are always owned by a
single transaction output, a series of `UPDATE` covenants for a name can used
like a linear message channel or, in a sense, a miniature independent blockchain
controlled by one Handshake name.

## Background

### Covenants

Several of the HNS covenants require an output's address to be identical to
the address in the output being spent. In the example below, `Addr 1` and `Addr 2`
lose an auction, and `Addr 3` is the winner. After confirming the `REGISTER`
covenant, that name owner can now start confirming a chain of `UPDATE` covenants,
each spending the one and only previous output that owned the name.

```                                                    
       ┌────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐                                      
Addr 1 │BID │───▶│REVEAL│───▶│REDEEM│                                      
       └────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘                                      
       ┌────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐                                      
Addr 2 │BID │───▶│REVEAL│───▶│REDEEM│                                      
       └────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘                                      
       ┌────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌────────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐
Addr 3 │BID │───▶│REVEAL│───▶│REGISTER│───▶│UPDATE│───▶│UPDATE│───▶│UPDATE│
       └────┘    └──────┘    └────────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘
```

### Namestate Data

The `UPDATE` covenant is allowed to commit to 512 bytes of data which will
eventually get committed to the HNS Urkel Tree and proven to light clients. This
data field currently **has absolutely no consensus rules applied to it**.

In the application layer, the first byte of this data is referred to as a `version`
and so far only version `0` has been defined: this is the HNS root zone record set.
Any data is still allowed after a version `0` byte, but if it is not formatted
correctly, the HNS root name server will simply ignore it.

## New Namestate Data Versions

Anyone can propose a new standard data format and collaborate with the community
to agree on a version number for that standard (we recommend writing a HIP). Layer
2 applications can process this data in a special way. Smart contracts, more
complex scripting systems, compiled bytecode can all be used as Namestate Data.
They may contain complex proofs like Bitcoin SPV merkle proofs to link
HNS names with BTC transactions.

> Example: TLD Token
>
> Version: `0xfe`
>
> Data: A series of tuples (`uint32`, `uint32`) indicating account numbers and
> their balance of the token.
>
> Update Chain: Commits to latest state of all account balances

## Extending Consensus Rules (soft forks)

Handshake full nodes verify every input and every output of every transaction in
every block. The UTXO script system is essentially copied from Bitcoin, but there
are extra consensus rules applied just to covenants. These rules always require
fully validating nodes to retrieve the current Namestate for a name before
determining whether or not the queued transaction is valid.

This means that without any additional disk or memory requirements, new consensus
rules can be applied to Update Chains by burdening data in `UPDATE` covenants
with new rules.

> Example: TLD Token
>
> New protocol rules:
>
> 1. The total sum of all "balance" fields in the covenant being
> evaluated MUST ALWAYS equal the sum of all "balance" fields in the existing
> Namestate data.
>
> 2. If the existing Namestate data is version `0xfe` then the version of the
> covenant data being evaluated MUST ALSO be `0xfe`

These rules make our example token chain a bit more reasonable. Tokens can not
be created or destroyed once the chain is first created. The name owner must
commit to the Update Chain forever and can not revert to data version `0` with
a future `UPDATE` covenant, which would break the Update Chain.

## Light Clients

The secure light client is an essential component of the Handshake ecosystem, and
any protocol extension should consider maintaining that compatibility. Since
the Urkel tree is updated periodically, the state of every Update Chain will be
verifiable by light clients after each tree commitment interval.

For some applications, the latest state may not be enough data to synchronize
the Update Chain state. Luckily, BIP37 has been expanded in Handshake to
include name hashes. This means that even an SPV node can get Merkle proofs of
every UDPATE transaction for a name, and may then be able to compute the state
of the system.

Normally this process would require a Bloom Filter upload and full chain rescan.
However, the data in an Update Chain can provide "hints". For example, part
of the data in each `UPDATE` can include the block hash of the previous `UPDATE`.
A light client can recursively request the full blocks indicated by these hints
and reconstruct the Update Chain using only the relevant blocks. This scheme is
similar to Neutrino wallets for Bitcoin which take advantage of BIP157 and BIP158.

## Access Modes

In combination with a chain of special-purpose data blobs, an Update Chain
can employ special types of output scripts to expand the use cases.

### Private

The name owner uses a standard pubKeyHash address and retains unilateral control
over the Update Chain. This may support applications proprietary to the name
itself, or be used as a trusted oracle.

### Public

The name owner transfers the name to an address locked by the following redeem
script "anyone can UPDATE or RENEW":

```
OP_TYPE
0x07 // UPDATE
OP_EQUAL
OP_IF
  OP_TRUE
OP_ELSE
  OP_TYPE
  0x08 // RENEW
  OP_EQUAL
OP_ENDIF
```

An Update Chain locked by this redeem script becomes a sort of public channel.
Anyone can `UPDATE` the data in the Namestate. Without a soft fork to enforce
extra consensus rules on that data this mode may be quite chaotic, but it could
be used a sort of communication channel that any HNS user can access.

### Pay-to-Update

The name owner transfers the name to an address locked by the following redeem
script "Key A can ONLY UPDATE, key B can do anything else":

```
OP_TYPE
0x07 // UPDATE
OP_EQUAL
OP_IF
  <Key A>
  OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ELSE
  <Key B>
  OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ENDIF

```

The name owner creates, partially signs with `Key A`, and publishes (off chain)
the following transaction:

```
vin:
  0: Key A signature with SIGHASH NO_INPUT | ANYONE_CAN_PAY | SINGLE_REVERSE
vout:
  0: (null)
  1: payment to name owner
```

Note that `SIGHASH NO_INPUT` means this same partially-signed transaction can
be used and re-used repeatedly as long as the name remains owned by the same
address. A more advanced script can also disable `TRANSFER` to ensure that this
is always the case for some applications.

The name owner uses two keys in the redeem script so that they can pre-sign
the spending of ANY output that owns the name but we must ensure that an attacker
can't take advantage of this pre-sign to transfer the name to themselves!

Any user who wishes to pay the name owner to `UPDATE` their chain completes the
transaction as follows:

```
vin:
  0: Key A signature with SIGHASH NO_INPUT | ANYONE_CAN_PAY | SINGLE_REVERSE
  1: User's funds
vout:
  0: User's UPDATE covenant with 512 byte payload
  1: User's change output
  2: payment to name owner
```

With this mechanism, a name owner can set a price which must be paid by any and
every user that wants to commit a message to the Update Chain.

In a variation of this mode, the name owner does NOT use `SIGHASH NO_INPUT` and
instead creates a pre-sign `UPDATE` only when requested by a user, with an
agreed-upon price and owner-approved `UPDATE` data.
